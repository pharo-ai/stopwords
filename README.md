## How to use it?

### Explore available stopwords 

You can use the class fa√ßade to quickly obtain a stop word Collection. It supports multiple stopwords repositories (implemented as subclasses), but a default list is automatically configured. Users could get a list of stop words for a language, you can use the pattern:

```smalltalk
AIStopwords for<Language>.
```

for example:

```smalltalk
AIStopwords forEnglish.
AIStopwords forSpanish.
AIStopwords forFrench.
```

To change the default stopword class for a language:

```smalltalk
AIStopwordsEnglish defaultStopwordClass: aClass.
```

Stopwords list were collected from https://github.com/igorbrigadir/stopwords

### Check for stopwords

Example of usage:

```smalltalk
'This is Ground Control to Major Tom' removeStopwordsUsing: AIStopwords forEnglish
```

will answer a Collection without the stopwords:

```smalltalk
#('Ground' 'Control' 'Major' 'Tom')
```
